# tut6

1. The backend code is completely from tut5, with folder Public and Src deleted. And it would use the port 3000 only.

2. Please type "mongo issuetracker scripts/init.mongo.js" to initialize the schema of database, also you can use "node scripts/trymongo.js" like said in the tut5. Then use command "npm start" to start up the service. 

3. Please download the code in the folder president, and use cmd to go into this folder. Then type "react-native run-android" to start. Please insure that you have run the Android Studio and AVD in advance.

4. You then should be able to see the input boxes. Input the name and phone numbers then the new customer would be added in the database. You can check by the playground. Notice that the name could not be empty and the phone numbers must only be 8 digits.
